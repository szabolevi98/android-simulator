# Android 2.1 Eclair (Nexus One) – features

[← Back to the README](../README.md)

The Nexus One as Google's February 2010 update left it: the factory build ERD79 with the official ERE27 over-the-air update applied (`google/passion/passion/mahimahi:2.1-update1/ERE27/24178`). Everything is rebuilt from that image alone (its APKs, odex code, resources and sounds); nothing is inherited from the other versions, and the code comments name the classes and resources each screen follows ([plan](plan-2.1.md), [sources](sources.md)). The image has no Hungarian: Hungarian is the Nexus S 2.3.6 image's translation of the same English text, or our own where that has none.

## System

- **Status bar and notifications:** the Eclair status bar with its icons, the pull-down shade with ongoing and latest events and Clear, and the trackball's notification light.
- **Lock screen:** the SlidingTab keyguard (unlock and silent mode), the pattern lock with its tutorial, setup and the wrong-pattern countdown, and the emergency dialer.
- **Power, recents and volume:** GlobalActions with silent and airplane mode, power off and the shutdown dialog, the boot animation, the recent applications dialog and the volume panel.
- **Keyboard:** the Android keyboard (LatinIME with voice input) with its own layouts, previews and long-press keys.

## Launcher

- **Launcher2:** five home screens with the default workspace, the Google search widget, the News and Weather and Power Control widgets, and the 3D All apps (the "rollo" drawer, drawn in WebGL).
- **Home screen editing:** a long press on an empty cell opens Add to Home screen; a long press on an item picks it up to move it, put it in a folder or drop it on the trashcan. The pickers list the image's own shortcuts (Applications, Bookmark, Contact, Direct dial, Direct message, Directions & Navigation, Gmail label, Music playlist, Settings, Toggle Google Voice), widgets (Analog clock, Calendar, Facebook, Music, News and Weather, Picture frame, Power Control, Search, YouTube) and folders (new folders and the live folders).

## Apps

- **Messaging:** conversations, compose, MMS attachments and slideshows, and the messaging settings.

Maps took most of its menus from a language file it downloaded; those texts come from screenshots of the time ([docs/data/ec-own.tsv](data/ec-own.tsv)).
