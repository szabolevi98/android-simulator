# Android 4.4.4 KitKat (Nexus 5) – features

[← Back to the README](../README.md)

`versions/4.4.4/` is Android 4.4.4 (build KTU84P, AOSP tag `android-4.4.4_r1`) on the Nexus 5, with its own saved data. It shows the stock Nexus 5: the Google Now Launcher, Google Now, Hangouts, Chrome, Gmail and Google+ Photos, which are not in AOSP and were rebuilt from 2013–2014 screenshots and Google's Android 4.4 Quick Start Guide. The AOSP Messaging, Browser and Gallery apps stay in the drawer. References and measurements are in [docs/visual-audit-4.4.md](visual-audit-4.4.md).

- **Nexus 5 and system bars:**
  - The frame is traced from Google's render.
  - The bars are translucent with gradients on the launcher and keyguard, and opaque in apps.
  - White status icons, the BatteryMeterView and the KitKat navigation keys.
- **Google Now Launcher (Launcher3):** the 4 × 4 Nexus 5 grid, the "Say “Ok Google”" search bar, the Google folder and Play Store, and the Phone / Hangouts / apps / Chrome / Camera dock.
  - Google Now is the leftmost screen, with weather, the next calendar event and the "Ok Google" tip card.
  - Dynamic pages: an empty page appears while you drag and is removed afterwards.
  - The two-screen default wallpaper pans with the pages.
  - All apps has no tabs and no widget pages. Folders are white.
  - Long-press opens the overview with Wallpapers, Widgets and Settings. Widgets open from there. The Launcher3 clings show on first run.
- **Wallpaper picker:**
  - It is fullscreen with the *Set wallpaper* bar.
  - The strip offers Pick image (through DocumentsUI "Open from"), the default wallpaper, the Google Now Launcher's eight bundled wallpapers, saved images and Sun Beam, the Nexus 5's only live wallpaper (Phase Beam in orange, redrawn in WebGL from its RenderScript and the APK's shaders).
  - Long-press a saved image to delete it.
  - Settings → Display → Wallpaper lists Gallery, Live Wallpapers, Photos and Wallpapers, as the KTU84P image registers them.
- **Keyguard:** the thin centred clock, the date and alarm row, and the Home-only navigation bar.
- **Notification panel:** 4.4 artwork, white Quick Settings icons, the battery tile and the Location tile.
- **Settings:** Tap & pay, Location modes, Printing, the default SMS app and Nexus 5 About phone. Tap Android version for the KitKat K and logo; long-press it for the immersive Dessert Case, which then becomes a daydream.
- **Phone and People:**

  - Clusters with MORE, the grouped permissions dialog, Additional information, and *Require password for purchases*.
- **Hangouts 2.0:** the SMS app, with the conversation list, the New Hangout picker and SMS conversations of white cards. Notifications and shares open it.
