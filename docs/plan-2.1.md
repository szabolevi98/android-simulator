# Android 2.1 on the Nexus One — plan

Started 2026-10-13. Build: **ERE27** (`google/passion/passion/mahimahi:2.1-update1/ERE27/24178`), the last 2.1 build of
the Nexus One (the February 2010 update; it also added Google Goggles). The catalogue says "2.1"; About phone shows the image's own
"2.1-update1". Folder `versions/2.1`, era prefix `ec-` (Eclair). How the image was put together: `docs/sources.md`.

## Rules: built from the image, nothing inherited

Earlier versions were copies of the previous one, and the copied screens kept working until someone rebuilt them; the
ones nobody reached stayed in the older look (ICS in Jelly Bean, Jelly Bean in KitKat, KitKat in Lollipop). 2.1 starts
the other way round:

1. **Only logic is copied** from 2.3.6: saving and loading, the click and form dispatch, navigation, timers, the
   calculator engine. No stylesheet, render function, string table or asset comes over.
2. **Nothing falls back to an older screen.** A screen that is not rebuilt yet shows a plain "not built yet" placeholder,
   so a gap is visible instead of quietly looking like Gingerbread.
3. **`ec-` files only.** `index.html` loads `ec-*` files and the logic-only files `tests/version-files.test.cjs` allows.
4. **Every asset comes from the passion image** (its hash is in the image, or `docs/data/asset-sources.tsv` names it as
   our own drawing), checked by the asset inventory. Every visible text is in `_aosp/passion/strings-index.json` or is
   marked `own`; a text that only the 2.3.6 image has is reported.
5. Hungarian: the 2.3.6 image's translation where the English text matches exactly, our own (marked `own`) otherwise.

## What the image holds (compared with the Nexus S 2.3.6)

- System look (`framework-res.apk`): 705 PNGs, 46 % byte-identical with 2.3.6. The status bar, notification panel, dialogs,
  menus, buttons and the lock screen are all different (2.1 has no SystemUI app; the status bar lives in the framework).
- Apps whose files are mostly shared with 2.3.6 but drawn differently in places: Launcher2 (77 % of PNGs identical, but
  the all-apps drawer is the RenderScript 3D roll), Settings (72 %), Browser (71 %), Mms (56 %), Contacts (51 %),
  Email (51 %), Calendar (42 %), Phone (38 %), Camera (24 %), Calculator (25 %).
- Google apps of the era: Gmail 1.3, Maps 3.4.0 (+ Street View 1.4), Talk 1.3, YouTube 1.5.20 (6 % shared — new work),
  Market 1.71, Voice Search 1.5.0, Google Voice 0.3.0, News and Weather 1.2.02, Goggles 1.0.1, Car Home, plus
  Facebook 1.1.3, Amazon MP3 1.6 and Quickoffice.
- Live wallpapers debuted on this phone: Grass, Galaxy, Water, Polar clock and Nexus (LiveWallpapers.apk), Magic Smoke,
  and the music visualizers Waveform, Spectrum, VU meter and Many.
- Locales: en, de, es, fr, it, ja, ko, pt, ru, zh — no Hungarian.

## Order of work (five-hour sessions)

| # | Step | Sessions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Image, tools, frame (`device-nexus-one.svg`), this plan | done 2026-10-13 |
| 2 | Scaffold: `index.html`, the logic-only core `ec-core.js`, placeholders, the leak checks (`tests/ec-leaks.test.cjs`); the catalogue entry follows with the home screen | done 2026-10-13 |
| 3 | Status bar, notification panel, lock screen, power menu, Launcher2 with the 3D drawer, menus and dialogs, trackball LED | 2 |
| 4 | Settings and the AOSP apps (Phone, Contacts, Messaging, Browser, Email, Calendar, Gallery, Camera, Music, Clock, Calculator) | 2–3 |
| 5 | Google apps, Market 1.71, widgets, live wallpapers | 2–3 |
| 6 | Language sweep, landing picture, docs, deploy (the OG cover stays as it is: owner's decision 2026-10-13) | 1 |

## The frame

`docs/tools/device-frames.py` draws `device-nexus-one.svg` (kept in `docs/data/` until the scaffold moves it to `versions/2.1/assets/`) from the front mockup on Wikimedia Commons
("Nexus One.png", Zach Vega, CC BY-SA 3.0; only its outline and the glass outline are traced): a brown-grey metal body,
black glass front with Back, Menu, Home and Search, the trackball (measured: ball r 19.5, black ring r 24 on the reference)
on the metal chin, the dark band where the body curves away under it, the charge LED right of the earpiece,
the short power key at the left end of the top edge (owner's photo) and the volume rocker on the left. The 3.7" display window is 255.3 × 425.5 px, the same
scale as the Nexus S (4.0", 276 × 460). A 2.1 home-screen capture for reference: Commons "Nexus one home screen 21.png".
