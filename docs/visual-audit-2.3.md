# Gingerbread 2.3.6 visual audit

Target: Android 2.3.6 (GRK39F) on the Nexus S (Samsung GT-I9020, `crespo`), the last GSM Nexus S release. AOSP references use the `android-2.3.6_r1` tag.

## Device frame — 2026-10-02

The Nexus S is an SVG drawing (`versions/2.3.6/assets/device-nexus-s.svg`) made by `docs/device-frames.py`, the same tool as the Galaxy Nexus and Nexus 4 frames.
- **Source.** The outline was traced from a front render on Wikimedia Commons ([File:Nexus S.png](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nexus_S.png), CC BY-SA 3.0, by Bea, derived from Luckyz's Nexus_S.jpg). Only the outline is traced: the alpha mask, with the side keys cut off, smoothed into a path. No pixels from the photo are used.
- **Drawn parts.** The glossy black Contour Display body has a thin plastic rim and the inner edge of the curved glass. The earpiece grille sits at the top centre with the front camera to its right. Power is on the right and the volume rocker on the left, at their measured heights.
- **Keys.** The four capacitive keys sit under the glass in the AOSP order: Back, Menu, Search, Home. The frame draws them unlit; the simulator lights them while they are in use.
- **Size.** The display window is 276 × 460, the 480 × 800 panel at 0.575. This keeps the 4.0" screen in proportion to the 4.65" Galaxy Nexus (545 px tall), and keeps the dp scale of the other versions (1 dp ≈ 0.86 CSS px). The whole frame is 336 × 675.

## Version scaffold and touch keys — 2026-10-02

`versions/2.3.6/` starts as a copy of the 4.0.4 directory, the way 4.3 did. It saves its state under `android-time-machine-gb-v1`. At the owner's request it is listed as available on the landing page from the start, first in the list, with a Nexus S miniature and a work-in-progress note, while the Gingerbread screens replace the inherited ICS ones step by step.

- **No navigation bar.** The ICS on-screen bar is gone, and the display uses the full 460 px height.
- **Keys.** The four Nexus S keys are buttons laid over the drawn glyphs on the glass: Back, Menu, Search and Home, at their centres 68 / 136 / 199.7 / 263.7 px across and 606.7 px down.
  - Back and Home behave as before.
  - Menu opens the current screen's options menu (for now the inherited per-app menus), and screens without one ignore it.
  - Search opens the Browser for now, until the Gingerbread Quick Search Box exists.
  - Holding Home for the 500 ms long-press timeout shows the recent apps.
- **Backlight.** The key glyphs are unlit at rest. Following `PowerManagerService` in 2.3.6 (`SCREEN_BUTTON_BRIGHT` on user activity, `LONG_KEYLIGHT_DELAY` = 6 s), any touch or key press lights them, and they go dark six seconds after the last activity.
- **Mobile.** In mobile full-screen mode the keys become a 52 px black bar under the display.
- **About phone.**
  - Model number: Nexus S. Android version: 2.3.6. Build number: GRK39F.
  - Kernel version: `2.6.35.7-gf5f63ef` / `android-build@apa28 #1` / `Tue Aug 2 13:57:05 PDT 2011`. This was read from the `Linux version` banner inside the prebuilt kernel at `device/samsung/crespo` `android-2.3.6_r1`. It is laid out with the 2.3.6 `DeviceInfoSettings` regex, which shortens the build host to `apa28`.
  - Baseband: `I9020XXKD1`. This is the GSM Nexus S radio from the 2.3.4 update, which the GRK39F OTA did not replace. It is an inference, since no published GRK39F "About phone" capture was found.
